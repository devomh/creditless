## Personal Log 004 (The bark is getting smoother with use)

**System Date Estimate:** 887.3.25 (The moon has waxed and waned once, I think, since I last tried to guess.)
**Author:** Kael
**Location:** Forest Edge, Overlooking the Valley, Under a Sky Full of Too Many Stars.

It happened at dusk, as the valley below began to fill with the soft, hazy light of cooking fires. I was gathering fallen branches for our own evening fire – a task I can now perform without setting myself or the surrounding foliage alight, most of the time. A small victory, that. Then, a flicker, high above. Not a bird, not one of the silent, gliding bats that dip and weave through the twilight. This was metallic, precise, catching the last rays of the setting sun with a cold, hard glint. A drone. *Their* drone. Sleek, obsidian-black, an aerodynamic predator against the deepening indigo sky.

My heart seized, a sudden, cold fist in my chest. For a breathless moment, I thought it was an attack, a remnant of whatever catastrophe severed my connection to the Network. A forgotten weapon finally locating its target. But it merely hovered, a dark, cruciform silhouette against the bleeding colors of sunset, its single optical sensor glowing with a faint, unwavering crimson light. Watching. Evaluating.

Then, something impossible happened. The old chrono-display I salvaged from a wrecked transport – a device I’d kept mostly as a paperweight, its screen usually displaying only erratic, meaningless symbols or a frustrating ‘NO SIGNAL’ – flickered. It lay on a rock beside my bundle of wood. Tonight, it pulsed, then lit up with a stark, cold purpose. Just four words, stark white against the cracked, grimy screen:

`CITIZEN RETRIEVAL AUTHORIZED.`
`UNIT 734-ALPHA-OMEGA-9 IDENTIFIED.`
`AWAITING OPTIMAL EXTRACTION WINDOW.`

Citizen. Not Kael. My old identifier string, a ghost from a past life. As if I were a faulty component being recalled, a piece of misplaced hardware. *Optimal extraction window.* The clinical precision of it chilled me more than the night air.

It’s still out there, the drone. I can see its faint marker light if I squint, a tiny, malevolent star that wasn’t there before. It’s been patrolling the valley’s edge all night, a silent, automated shepherd, its movements too smooth, too calculated to be anything but machine. Waiting. For what? For me to step out into the open? To signal compliance?

The message on the chrono-display hasn’t changed. It glows with a faint, insistent light, a beacon from a world I thought had forgotten me, or I, it. `RETRIEVAL AUTHORIZED.` Like a lost data packet found corrupted and needing to be restored to factory settings.

They must have detected my bio-signature, amplified perhaps by some residual signal from the tech I carried, or maybe even this very datapad as I write. Functional again. That’s what it means, doesn’t it? I’m no longer lost, broken, or disconnected in a way that makes me their problem to write off. I’m now a resource to be collected. An asset to be reintegrated.

A part of me, a deeply buried, shamefully conditioned part, felt a flicker of… relief? The promise of return to effortless comfort, to seamless connection, to a world where I *understood* the rules, where I *mattered* in a way these Off-Gridders, for all their quiet strength, could never comprehend. That old Kael, the one who valued processing power over resilience, algorithmic praise over a shared glance of understanding, whispered, *‘Yes. Go back. This has all been a terrible mistake.’*

But the irony is a bitter shard in my throat now, sharper than any splinter from the wood I gathered. After all this time, after I’ve started to understand the rhythm of this place, the weight of real things in my hands, the ache of honest labor in my bones, the quiet satisfaction of a task done, a fire lit, a wall mended. After I’ve felt something other than the constant, demanding thrum of the Network in my head. After I’ve seen the stars, unfiltered by atmospheric domes, and felt the wind, untamed.

They didn’t send a message asking if I was okay, if I was hurt, if I was… changed. They didn’t send a team to negotiate with the Off-Grid, to offer aid or apology. They sent an automated retrieval unit, a machine to collect a machine.

They didn’t ask if I *wanted* to return. Only if I was functional again, a recoverable asset. My designation, my identifier string, confirmed. That is all.

The chrono-display glows. The drone waits, a patient predator in the dark. And I… I watch them both, and for the first time in a long, long time, I’m not sure what functioning even means anymore. Or which world is the simulation. Or who, exactly, they are coming to retrieve. That Kael, I think, might already be gone. End log.
