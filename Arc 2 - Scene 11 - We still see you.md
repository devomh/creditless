## Personal Log 004 (The bark is getting smoother with use)

**Est. Date:** 887.3.25 (Moon’s cycled once, I think. Hard to track time here.)
**Author:** Kael
**Location:** Forest Edge. Overlooking the valley. Sky full of too many stars.

Dusk. Valley filling with the soft, hazy light of cooking fires. I was gathering fallen branches—a task I manage now, mostly, without incinerating myself or the local flora. A small victory. Then, a flicker, high above. Not bird, not bat. Metallic. Precise. Catching last sun-rays with a cold, hard glint. A drone. *Their* drone. Sleek, obsidian, aerodynamic predator against the deepening indigo.

Heart seized. Cold fist in my chest. A breathless moment—attack? Remnant of the catastrophe that severed me? Forgotten weapon, target acquired? But it merely hovered, dark cruciform against bleeding sunset colors, its single optical sensor a faint, unwavering crimson eye. Watching. Evaluating.

Then, the impossible. My salvaged chrono-display—kept as paperweight, screen usually erratic, meaningless symbols, or ‘NO SIGNAL’—flickered. On a rock beside my wood. It pulsed. Lit up with stark, cold purpose. Four lines, white on cracked, grimy screen:

`CITIZEN RETRIEVAL AUTHORIZED.`
`UNIT 734-ALPHA-OMEGA-9 IDENTIFIED.`
`AWAITING OPTIMAL EXTRACTION WINDOW.`

Citizen. Not Kael. My old identifier string—ghost from a past life. A faulty component recalled. Misplaced hardware. *Optimal extraction window.* Clinical precision. Chilled me more than the night air.

Still out there, the drone. Its faint marker light, a tiny, malevolent star where none was before. Patrolling the valley’s edge all night, a silent, automated shepherd. Movements too smooth, too calculated. Machine. Waiting. For what? For me to step into the open? Signal compliance?

Chrono-display unchanged. Glows with faint, insistent light—beacon from a world I thought had forgotten me, or I, it. `RETRIEVAL AUTHORIZED.` Like a lost data packet, corrupted, needing factory reset.

They detected my bio-signature. Or residual tech signals. Or this datapad, as I write. Functional again. That’s it, isn’t it? No longer lost, broken, disconnected—their problem to write off. Now, a resource to collect. An asset to reintegrate.

A part of me, deeply buried, shamefully conditioned, felt… relief? A flicker. Promise of effortless comfort, seamless connection. A world where I *understood*, where I *mattered* in ways these Off-Gridders, for all their quiet strength, never could. That old Kael—valuing processing power over resilience, algorithmic praise over a shared glance—whispered, *‘Yes. Go back. This was all a terrible mistake.’*

But irony, a bitter shard in my throat, sharper than any splinter from the wood. After all this time. After understanding the rhythm of this place, weight of real things in my hands, ache of honest labor in my bones. Quiet satisfaction: task done, fire lit, wall mended. After feeling something other than the Network’s constant, demanding thrum. After seeing stars unfiltered by atmospheric domes, feeling wind untamed.

They didn’t ask if I was okay. Hurt. Changed. They sent no team to negotiate, offer aid, apologize. An automated retrieval unit. A machine to collect a machine.

They didn’t ask if I *wanted* to return. Only if I was functional again. A recoverable asset. My designation confirmed. That is all.

Chrono-display glows. Drone waits, patient predator in the dark. I watch them both. For the first time in so long, I’m unsure what functioning even means. Or which world is the simulation. Or who, exactly, they retrieve.
That Kael, I think, is already gone. End log.
