**Author:** Kael
**Location:** Forest Edge, Overlooking the Valley

It happened at dusk. I was gathering fallen branches for the evening fire – a task I can now perform without setting myself or the surrounding foliage alight, most of the time. A flicker, high above. Not a bird, not one of the bats that dip and weave through the twilight. This was metallic, precise. A drone. Their drone.

My heart seized. For a moment, I thought it was an attack, a remnant of whatever catastrophe severed the Network. But it merely hovered, a dark silhouette against the deepening indigo sky, its optical sensor glowing faintly.

Then, the old chrono-display I salvaged from a wrecked transport flickered. It’s been mostly useless, a paperweight showing erratic, meaningless symbols. Tonight, it lit up with purpose. Just four words, stark white against the cracked screen: `CITIZEN RETRIEVAL AUTHORIZED.`

Citizen. Not Kael. Not even my old identifier string. Just… citizen. As if I were a faulty component being recalled.

It’s still out there, the drone. I can see its faint marker light if I squint, a malevolent star that wasn’t there before. It’s been patrolling the valley’s edge all night, a silent, automated shepherd. Waiting.

The message on the chrono-display hasn’t changed. `CITIZEN RETRIEVAL AUTHORIZED.`

Retrieval. Like a lost data packet.

They must have detected my bio-signature, or perhaps some residual signal from the tech I carried. Functional again. That’s what it means. I’m no longer lost, broken, or disconnected in a way that makes me their problem to write off. I’m now a resource to be collected.

The irony is a bitter shard in my throat. After all this time, after I’ve started to understand the rhythm of this place, the weight of real things, the ache of honest labor. After I’ve felt something other than the constant thrum of the Network in my head.

They didn’t send a message asking if I was okay. They didn’t send a team to negotiate with the Off-Grid. They sent an automated retrieval unit.

They didn’t ask if I *wanted* to return. Only if I was functional again.

The chrono-display glows. The drone waits. And I… I watch them both, and for the first time in a long, long time, I’m not sure what functioning even means anymore.
