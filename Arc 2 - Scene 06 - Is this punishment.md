## Log Entry 024

**Location:** Off-Grid Community, Unnamed Structure

The blanket is… coarse. Not like the synth-silk I’m used to. It scratches, but it’s warm. Everything here is so aggressively real. My muscles ache in places I didn’t know existed. Yesterday, I helped turn soil. Actual soil, with my hands. Today, I can barely lift my arms.

Through the open window – a real window, with glass that feels cool to the touch and a wooden frame that has splinters – I see them. The Off-Gridders. They’re digging, not with plasma shovels, but with metal and wood. They’re repairing a wall, their movements practiced, economical. There are no floating schematics guiding them, just… knowledge. Passed down, I suppose.

And they laugh. It’s a strange sound, unfiltered by speakers, unprompted by a laugh track. It’s raw, like the wood of this bed frame. No screens flicker here, no data streams fill the air. Just the thud of tools, the murmur of voices, the rustle of leaves in the wind I can actually feel on my skin.

It’s been three days since the… incident. Three days since Elara’s message, since the Network went dark, since I found myself here. Rescued? Abducted? I’m still not sure.

My first official log entry from this new… reality. It feels less like an entry and more like a question screamed into a void I’m only just beginning to comprehend.

Is this punishment? For relying too much on the Network? For not questioning?

Or is this what reality always was, beneath the layers of curated experience and simulated ease? Did we all just forget?

My datapad is useless, of course. No signal. No connection. Just a dead weight in my pack. For the first time, my thoughts are entirely my own, unaugmented, unfiltered. And they are… loud.

The ache in my shoulders is a constant reminder. This isn’t a simulation. This isn’t a historical reenactment. This is now. And I have no idea what to do.
