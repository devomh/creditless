## Personal Log 001 (If anyone ever sees this—doubtful.)

**Est. Date:** 887.3.15 (Chrono’s dead. Three days since cutoff.)
**Author:** Kael. (Formerly Resident ID 734-Alpha-Omega-9, Arcology New Alexandria. Now… just Kael. Apparently.)
**Location:** Primitive hut. Off-Grid. ‘The Warren,’ they call it. Charming.

Blanket: coarse. Animal hair? Scratches. Not my temperature-regulating synth-silk. But it’s warm; nights here are shockingly cold. Everything’s aggressively, painfully real. Muscles ache—places I didn’t know *were* muscles—deep, burning soreness. Every movement, a fresh insult. Yesterday, the ‘Engineer’ (that woman) made me ‘turn soil.’ Actual dirt. With my *hands*. Cold, damp, under my fingernails. Lasted ten minutes? Nearly collapsed. Arms useless today. She thinks I’m worthless. In this world, maybe I am.

Open window (real glass, cool, rattles; splintered wood frame, not a projection) shows… them. Off-Gridders. Digging. Not with plasma shovels or excav-drones. Crude metal and wood tools. Repairing a wall of mud and logs? Movements practiced, economical. Annoyingly synchronized. No floating schematics. No AI oversight. Just… knowledge. In their heads. How inefficient. Prone to error.

They laugh. Strange sound. Unfiltered. Unprompted by laugh-track algos. Raw, like this bed frame. Loud, sometimes. Booming. No screens flicker. No data streams glow. Just thudding tools, murmuring voices (dialect I barely comprehend), rustling leaves from wind I *feel* on my skin. Disconcerting.

Three days since the Network vanished for me. Since my world ended. Dragged here. Rescue? Abduction? Uncomfortable charity, I suppose.

First log attempt on this dead datapad. Screen dark. No power, no connection. But the local journal function—a ridiculously archaic feature—accessible. Minimal power reserve. Typing on glass. Primitive. Just text. No voice dictation, no neuro-linker.

Less an entry, more a scream into a void. A void where my credentials, my access, my *name*… mean nothing.

Punishment? For relying on the Network? Not questioning its authority? Too complacent? Absurd. Everyone lived that way.

Or is *this* reality? Beneath the curated experiences, the simulated ease of the arcologies? Did we all forget how to exist without the System coddling us 24/7? Terrifying thought.

Datapad otherwise useless. No signal. Dead weight. Reminder of a life that feels like a dream. My thoughts—entirely my own. Unaugmented. Unfiltered. Loud. Mostly angry. Confused.

Shoulder ache, a constant throb. Not a sim. Not historical reenactment for difficult academics. This is *now*. No idea what to do. How to get back. If ‘back’ even exists for me.

Engineer just brought… ‘food.’ Smells earthy. Assuming I can stomach it.
End log. I guess.
