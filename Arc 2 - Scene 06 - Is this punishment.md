## Personal Log 001 (If anyone ever even sees this)

**System Date Estimate:** 887.3.15? The chrono on my datapad died with everything else. Three days since… the cutoff.
**Author:** Kael, formerly Resident ID 734-Alpha-Omega-9, The Arcology of New Alexandria. Now… just Kael, apparently.
**Location:** Some kind of primitive hut. Off-Grid Community. They call it ‘The Warren,’ I think I heard one say. Charming.

This blanket they gave me is… coarse. Made of some kind of rough animal hair, I think. Not like the temperature-regulating synth-silk I’m used to. It scratches, but it’s warm, and the nights here are shockingly cold. Everything here is so aggressively, painfully real. My muscles ache in places I didn’t know existed, a deep, burning soreness that makes every movement a fresh insult. Yesterday, that woman – the ‘Engineer’ – made me help her ‘turn soil.’ Actual soil. With my hands. It was cold, and damp, and got under my fingernails. I think I managed about ten minutes before I nearly collapsed. Today, I can barely lift my arms. She probably thinks I’m completely useless. Maybe I am, in this world.

Through the open window – a real window, not a projection, with actual glass that feels cool and sometimes rattles, set in a wooden frame that has splinters – I see them. The Off-Gridders. They’re digging something, not with plasma shovels or autonomous excavators, but with crude tools of metal and wood. They’re repairing a wall made of… mud and logs? Their movements are practiced, economical, annoyingly synchronized. There are no floating schematics guiding them, no AI oversight. Just… knowledge. Stored in their heads, I suppose. How inefficient. How prone to error.

And they laugh. It’s a strange sound, unfiltered by any audio enhancement, unprompted by a laugh track algorithm. It’s raw, like the wood of this bed frame I’m lying on. Sometimes it’s loud, booming. No screens flicker here, no data streams fill the air with their comforting glow. Just the thud of tools, the murmur of their voices in a dialect I barely understand, the rustle of leaves in a wind I can actually feel on my skin. It’s… disconcerting.

It’s been three days since the… incident. Three days since my entire world simply vanished. Since the Network went dark for me. Since I found myself dragged here. Rescued? Abducted? I’m still not sure what to call it. Charity, I suppose, of a very uncomfortable kind.

This is my first attempt at a log entry on my supposedly ‘dead’ datapad. The screen is dark, of course, no power, no connection. But the local journal function, a ridiculously archaic feature I never knew existed, seems to be accessible via some kind of minimal power reserve if I type directly onto the glass. Just text. No voice dictation, no neuro-linker. Primitive.

It feels less like an entry and more like a question screamed into a void I’m only just beginning to comprehend. A void where my credentials, my access, my *name* as it was, mean nothing.

Is this some kind of elaborate punishment? For relying too much on the Network? For not questioning its absolute authority? Was I too… complacent? It seems absurd. Everyone lived that way.

Or is this what reality always was, beneath the layers of curated experience and simulated ease the arcologies provided? Did we all just forget how to… exist without the System holding our hands every second of the day? The thought is terrifying.

My datapad is useless for anything else, of course. No signal. No connection. Just a dead weight in my pack, a reminder of a life that might as well be a dream. For the first time, my thoughts are entirely my own, unaugmented by information streams, unfiltered by predictive algorithms. And they are… loud. And mostly angry. And confused.

The ache in my shoulders is a constant, throbbing reminder. This isn’t a simulation. This isn’t a historical reenactment they subject recalcitrant academics to. This is now. And I have no idea what to do. Or how to get back. Or even if ‘back’ still exists for me.
The Engineer just brought me something resembling food. It smells… earthy. I have to go. Assuming I can even stomach this. End log, I guess.
