The summons came just after the meager morning meal – a thin porridge Kael was still struggling to acquire a taste for. One of the younger Off-Gridders, a boy named Tam with perpetually dirt-stained hands, approached Kael. “Engineer needs you. Water rig, section three. It’s leaking again.”

Kael’s stomach tightened. Another opportunity to demonstrate their incompetence. The water rig was a lifeline for the community, a complex network of pipes and filters salvaged from who-knows-what ruins, channeling water from an upland spring. A leak wasn’t just an inconvenience; it was a threat.

When Kael arrived, the Rewilded Engineer was already there, her expression as grim as the grey sky overhead. Water sprayed erratically from a joint in a large, rust-corroded pipe, pooling into muddy puddles. Two other Off-Gridders were struggling to tighten a makeshift clamp around the rupture, their efforts only seeming to worsen the spray.

“You,” the Engineer barked, not looking at Kael but gesturing towards the chaotic scene. “See if that city brain of yours can think of something besides how to get your boots dirty.”

The sarcasm wasn’t unexpected, but it still stung. Kael approached cautiously, the hissing water and grunts of exertion a stark contrast to the quiet, sterile labs they were used to. The Off-Gridders were trying to apply brute force, their muscles straining against the pressure. Kael watched the way the water pulsed from the split, the way the metal around the rupture seemed to bulge slightly before each new jet.

An image surfaced in Kael’s mind, unbidden. It was from an old engineering simulation, one of their earliest training modules: ‘Fluid Dynamics under Duress – Pre-Network Era Solutions.’ It had been a theoretical exercise, a historical curiosity. They’d almost dismissed it.

“Wait,” Kael said, surprised at the steadiness of their own voice. The two wrestling with the clamp paused, looking at Kael with a mixture of suspicion and desperation. Even the Engineer turned her head slightly.

“The pressure is too direct,” Kael explained, pointing. “You’re fighting the main vector of the leak. See how the pipe bulges there, just before the split? The stress is highest at that point. If you could create a counter-pressure point *before* the main rupture, it might redistribute the stress along the pipe wall and allow the clamp to hold.”

Blank stares. Kael sighed internally. They didn’t have the language of the Off-Grid, the practical, hands-on vocabulary. They had theory.

“Here,” Kael said, stepping forward. They picked up a smaller, discarded piece of pipe and a sturdy wedge of wood. “If we can wedge this against the pipe, just here”—they indicated a spot about a hand’s breadth before the leak—“and create a temporary girding, it might lessen the outward force at the rupture itself.”

The Engineer watched, arms crossed, her expression unreadable. The other two looked hesitant but stepped back, allowing Kael to try.

It was awkward. The metal was slick, the ground muddy. Kael’s fingers, more accustomed to holographic interfaces, fumbled with the rough materials. But the logic of the simulation held. They positioned the wedge, then used a heavy stone to carefully hammer the piece of pipe against it, creating a crude but effective pressure band. The bulging near the leak visibly lessened. The wild spray reduced to a more manageable, steady stream.

“Now try the clamp,” Kael urged, stepping back, heart pounding.

The two Off-Gridders, with a shared glance, reapplied their clamp. This time, it held. The hissing lessened, then stopped. A few drips, then silence, save for the continued flow of water *through* the pipe.

A collective sigh of relief went through the small group. Tam grinned at Kael. The two who’d fixed the clamp nodded, a grudging respect in their eyes.

Kael looked at the Rewilded Engineer. She was still watching them, her expression unchanged for a long moment. Then, almost imperceptibly, she gave a single, sharp nod.

It wasn’t praise, not really. It was an acknowledgment. A recognition of utility. For Kael, it felt like a torrent of applause.

The datapad is still inert, a useless brick. But I find myself wanting to record this anyway, even if it’s just for me, scratched onto a piece of preserved bark with a charred stick – another borrowed technology.

I didn’t fail today.

There was a leak in the water rig. A bad one. They were trying to force it, but the pressure was wrong. I remembered a simulation – fluid dynamics, stress vectors. Archaic stuff, really. But it worked. I showed them how to brace it, to redirect the stress. The clamp held.

The Engineer… she nodded. Just a nod. But it was enough.

My hands are scraped. I have mud in places I didn’t know mud could reach. I’m exhausted. But I didn’t fail. It’s a strange feeling. Almost like… satisfaction. Is this what it feels like to be useful? Not for accumulating credits, or commendations, but for something real? Something that means people have water to drink?

Strange. So strange.
