## Scene 14: Log for the Forgotten

**Personal Log: Elara Vayne. System Date: 887.5.12 Standard Cycle.**
**Entry Point: Public Access Terminal 7-Delta, Civic Hub 3.**
**Subject: Notes from an Unscheduled Sabbatical.**

They call it reentry. I call it… a return to a different kind of wilderness. One with softer edges but deeper shadows. My credits are restored. The System welcomed me back with open arms and offered to optimize my reintegration. I declined the optimization. Some things, I’m learning, aren’t meant to be seamless.

This log isn’t for the System, though. It’s for anyone still listening, anyone who feels the hum of the arcology in their bones and wonders if that’s all there is. For those who have forgotten, or were never told, what lies beyond the signal’s reach.

I spent time where the only credit was the sun’s warmth, the only network the roots of trees. I learned the language of silence again, broken only by wind or the crackle of a shared fire. There were cold nights, yes, where the chill seeped into your marrow. But then there was the fire, and the faces lit by it, sharing stories that weren’t streamed but spoken. There was the ache in my muscles from work that mattered – mending a fence, tending a sprout, clearing a path. Real things.

I learned that failure isn’t fatal. A seed might not take. A weld might not hold. You try again. You learn. You adapt. The System here cushions every fall, anticipates every need, until you forget you have legs, until you forget you can build something with your own two hands that doesn’t ask permission to exist.

I don’t have answers. I don’t have a manifesto. Only this: there is a world outside the algorithms. A world that is beautifully, terribly, imperfectly real. It demands more of you, and in return, it gives you back a part of yourself you might not even know you’ve lost.

If you find this, if these words mean anything against the noise… perhaps it’s time to seek a different kind of signal. Perhaps it’s time to remember what it feels like to be truly, tangibly alive.
