## Log: An Unscheduled Sabbatical (Kael Vayne)

**System Date:** 887.5.12 (Terminal’s claim.)
**Entry Point:** Public Access Terminal 7-Delta, Civic Hub 3, Sector Gamma. Anonymous mode engaged—though true anonymity here feels like a System myth. The terminal hums, sterile energy. Strange, typing on a public surface again, bathed in cool, impersonal data-light. My datapad felt too private, too tied to my old self. This isn't for that Kael.

They call my return ‘reentry.’ I call it returning to a different wilderness—softer edges, deeper shadows. Credits restored. The System, with its synthetic smile, offered to ‘optimize’ my reintegration. I declined. Some things shouldn’t be seamless. Some lessons are etched in scars, not smoothed by algorithms.

This log isn’t for the System. Its processors will likely flag it anomalous, file it as irrelevant data. This is for anyone listening with human ears, anyone feeling the arcology’s constant hum in their bones, wondering if this is all. For those who’ve forgotten, or were never told, what lies beyond signal’s reach, beyond curated sensory feeds.

I lived where sunlight on skin was the only credit, tree roots the only network, holding earth together. I learned silence again—not empty, but full of rustling leaves, a distant bird’s call, a shared fire’s crackle. Cold nights, yes, chilling marrow, making you doubt dawn. But then, fire built with your own hands; faces lit by it, sharing stories not streamed but spoken, voice to voice, eye to eye. Muscle-ache from work that mattered: mending a fence against the wild, tending a sprout promising food, clearing a path for others. Real things. Left you tired, but whole.

I learned failure isn’t always fatal. A seed might not take. A weld, not hold. A fire might resist the first, even tenth, try. You try again. Learn. Adapt. Ask for help—find it given without transaction log. The System here, in its perfection, cushions every fall, anticipates every need, until you forget you have legs, forget your own hands can build something that asks no permission, needs no validation from a thousand ‘likes’ or a rising metric.

I offer no manifestos, no grand plans to dismantle arcologies. Only this: a world exists outside algorithms, beyond shimmering walls. Beautifully, terribly, imperfectly real. It demands more—attention, strength, patience. In return, it gives back parts of yourself you might not know you’ve lost. Shows what your hands can do, your heart can bear, your voice can mean when it truly speaks.

If this finds you, if these words resonate in a quiet space amidst the constant noise… perhaps it’s time. Time to seek a different signal—not one that streams, but one that grows. Not one that computes, but one that connects: skin to earth, hand to hand.

I left that other world. I learned. I was changed.
Maybe you can too.
