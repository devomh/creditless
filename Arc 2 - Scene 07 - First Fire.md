The unfiltered sun beat Kael’s neck with oppressive heat. Sweat, a novel sensation for one accustomed to climate-controlled enviro-suits, trickled, making their borrowed shirt cling. Before them: a cleared patch of earth, a haphazard pile of mismatched twigs Kael had grudgingly gathered, and a flint and steel—alien, brutish tools in their synth-skinned, delicate hands.

“A cooking fire,” the Rewilded Engineer had grunted earlier, voice like grinding rocks. Intimidated by her uncompromising presence, Kael hadn’t asked her name. Most here were just ‘Engineer,’ ‘Forager,’ ‘Healer’—titles of utility. Kael was, painfully clearly, ‘Useless.’ Or ‘City-Dweller,’ uttered with a faintly pitying headshake.

The Engineer had gestured with her chin at a crude spit nearby, where a plucked, featherless bird – a creature Kael vaguely recognized from a zoological database as *Gallus gallus domesticus*, albeit a scrawnier version – awaited. “No fire, no food. No work, no eat.”

Simple. Infuriating. And utterly beyond Kael’s current capabilities.

Kael fumbled with flint and steel, rough surfaces abrading soft palms. Archaic. Something from a badly rendered historical sim. Sparks should come from sonic igniters, plasma starters, gesture-controlled. Not by striking rock and metal with brute, uncalibrated force. First hesitant tap: nothing. Second, forceful scrape: a pathetic spark arced sideways, died on damp earth. A quickly suppressed (but heard) snicker drifted from younger Off-Gridders mending nets nearby, their fingers nimble and practiced. Kael’s ears burned hotter than any spark.

Again. Teeth gritted. Some physics principle—angles, friction? *Not quantum mechanics, Kael. Just rocks.* A decent spark! It landed on the tinder—dried grass and shaved bark from the Engineer. Smoldered, a thrilling orange eye, then winked out despite Kael’s hopeful stare.

“Wood’s damp,” Kael muttered, prodding a branch with a useless, thin-soled boot. Heavy. Saturated. Arcology moisture content: precisely calibrated. Here: just wet. An obstacle.

“Then find dry wood.” The Engineer didn’t look up from her whetstone, each stroke against her axe rhythmic, purposeful. Her tone implied profound, self-evident idiocy on Kael’s part.

Kael ventured a short distance, scanning the undergrowth with distaste. Everything damp, rotten, or crawling. Air heavy with moisture from a recent, unnoticed rain. They snapped a few twigs—most bent limply—and returned, feeling critical eyes on their back.

Another attempt. More feeble sparks. One caught—a tiny, courageous flame. Eager, Kael leaned in, blew a desperate puff—like trying to accelerate a stalled processor fan. Flame vanished. More laughter, less suppressed.

“Sweet-talking it, city-dweller?” a youth called, grinning. “Fire don’t like whispers!”

Kael’s hands trembled—exertion, yes, but more from a rising tide of frustration, acute humiliation. They, Kael—who’d interfaced with planetary networks, debated multi-variant AI ethics, recalibrated satellite trajectories with elegant code—couldn’t make fire. A task mastered millennia ago. Degrading.

Tried a cone of wood, per ancient vids. Collapsed. Tried a log-cabin. Collapsed, scattering precious, less-damp twigs. Scraped knuckles with flint. Smoke stung their eyes, blurring vision. Singed fingertips—yelped, snatched hand back, acrid smell of burnt synth-skin and their own flesh. Knocked over the waterskin; precious liquid soaked uselessly into damp earth. More chuckles.

An eternity of fumbling, smoke, spilled water, quiet mockery. Finally, the Engineer rose. Fluid grace, boots silent on packed earth. Wordlessly, she crouched by the fire pit. Kael watched, shame a cold snake in their gut, stepped back, expecting reprimand or pity.

The Engineer’s calloused, sure hands selected a few pieces of Kael’s discarded wood. With a worn but keen knife Kael hadn’t seen her draw, she shaved fine, feathery curls from a branch’s dry inner core, letting them fall into an airy pile on the tinder. Took flint and steel from Kael’s unresisting, dirt-stained fingers. Firm, practiced grip. No wild strikes. Steady, patient rhythm: steel drawn firmly down flint, sparks angled precisely onto feather sticks. Once. Twice. Three times.

Third strike: a shower of brilliant sparks. They caught. She blew gently—not Kael’s panicked puff, but a long, controlled breath, coaxing a living thing. Ember glowed, blossomed into a tiny, confident flame. Slowly, deliberately, she added small twigs, then larger, building the fire with an instinct Kael couldn’t fathom. Master artisan at work: precise, economical, effective. Within minutes, a small, steady fire crackled merrily, radiating welcome warmth Kael, despite humiliation, leaned towards.

The Engineer met Kael’s gaze—direct, unwavering. No malice. Stark assessment.

“No credits here,” she said, voice low, clear over the fire’s crackle. “No simulations. No AI hand-holding. No safety nets.” A chin gesture at Kael’s reddened, blistered fingertips. “Just consequence. Learn, or burn. Work, or starve.”

She rose, returned to her axe. Kael stared at the flames, her words settling like the coming night’s chill. This was Off-Grid. Survival: a currency Kael had yet to earn, a language yet to speak. The small, dancing fire, a universe from their old life.
