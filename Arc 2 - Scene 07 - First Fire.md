The sun, unfiltered by atmospheric lensing or the tinted plasteel of city domes, beat down on Kael’s neck. Sweat, a sensation usually managed by climate-controlled enviro-suits, trickled unpleasantly down their back. Before them lay a small, cleared patch of earth, a pile of mismatched twigs and branches, and a flint and steel that felt alien in their synth-skinned hands.

“A cooking fire,” the Rewilded Engineer had grunted, her voice like rocks grinding together. She was a woman whose age was impossible to guess, her face a roadmap of sun and wind, her eyes holding a disconcerting sharpness. She hadn’t offered her name, and Kael hadn’t dared ask. Most here were just ‘Engineer,’ ‘Forager,’ ‘Healer’ – titles that defined their utility. Kael was, so far, ‘Useless.’

The Engineer had gestured to a crude spit already erected nearby, where a plucked, featherless bird – a creature Kael vaguely recognized from a zoological database – awaited. “No fire, no food.”

Simple. Infuriatingly simple.

Kael fumbled with the flint and steel. The concept was archaic, something out of a historical simulation. Sparks were meant to come from sonic igniters, or plasma starters, not from striking two bits of rock and metal together. Their first attempt sent a pathetic spark arcing sideways, landing harmlessly on the damp earth. A snicker, quickly suppressed, drifted from a group of younger Off-Gridders mending nets nearby. Kael’s ears burned hotter than any spark they’d produced.

They tried again, gritting their teeth. This time, a spark landed on the tinder – a small bundle of dried grass and shaved bark the Engineer had provided. It smoldered for a moment, a tiny orange eye, then winked out.

“The wood is damp,” Kael muttered, prodding a branch with the toe of their boot. It felt heavy, saturated. Back in the arcology, moisture content was a precisely calibrated variable in any combustion process. Here, it was just… wet.

“Then find dry wood,” the Engineer said, not looking up from the axe she was sharpening with a whetstone. Her tone implied this was the most obvious thing in the world.

Kael ventured a short distance, scanning the undergrowth. Everything looked damp. The air itself felt heavy with moisture from a recent rain shower they hadn’t even registered, cocooned as they’d been in their scratchy blanket. They gathered a few more twigs, trying to select the least sodden ones, and returned to the fire pit.

Another attempt. More feeble sparks. One caught, and Kael, in their eagerness, piled on too many twigs too quickly, smothering the fragile flame. A wisp of acrid smoke stung their eyes, making them water. This time, the laughter from the net-menders was less suppressed.

“Need a waterskin for those tears, city-dweller?” one called out, his face split by a grin.

Kael’s hands were trembling, not just from exertion, but from a rising tide of frustration and humiliation. They’d managed complex orbital mechanics calculations, debugged neural network AI, even performed emergency micro-surgery on a damaged drone mid-flight. But they couldn’t make fire.

They tried to arrange the wood in a cone, as they’d seen in some ancient vids. It collapsed. They tried a log-cabin structure. It also collapsed. They singed their fingertips, yelping and snatching their hand back, the smell of burnt synth-skin acrid in their nostrils. They spilled the small waterskin they’d been given, the precious liquid soaking uselessly into the already damp earth.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of fumbling, smoke, and quiet mockery, the Engineer rose. She moved with a fluid grace that belied her rugged appearance. Wordlessly, she crouched by the fire pit. Kael watched, shame coiling in their gut.

The Engineer’s hands, calloused and sure, selected a few pieces of Kael’s discarded wood. With a knife Kael hadn’t seen her draw, she shaved fine, feathery curls from the driest part of a branch. She arranged these in a small, airy pile. Then, taking the flint and steel from Kael’s unresisting fingers, she struck them together. Not once, not twice, but with a steady, patient rhythm.

A spark caught on the feather sticks. She blew gently, not with Kael’s panicked puff, but with a controlled breath that coaxed the ember into a tiny flame. Slowly, deliberately, she added a few more small twigs, then slightly larger ones, building the fire with an instinct Kael couldn’t fathom. Within minutes, a small, steady fire crackled in the pit, radiating a welcome warmth.

The Engineer looked at Kael, her gaze direct, unwavering.

“No credits out here,” she said, her voice low but carrying clearly. “No simulations. No safety nets. Just consequence.” She gestured to Kael’s reddened, slightly blistered fingers. “You learn, or you burn. You work, or you starve.”

She rose and walked back to her axe, leaving Kael staring at the flames, the simple, profound truth of her words settling into their bones like the chill of the coming night. This was the Off-Grid. And survival was a currency Kael had yet to earn.
