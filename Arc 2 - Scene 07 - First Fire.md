The sun, unfiltered by atmospheric lensing or the tinted plasteel of city domes, beat down on Kael’s neck with an unfamiliar, oppressive heat. Sweat, a sensation usually wicked away by climate-controlled enviro-suits before it could even form, trickled unpleasantly down their back, making the coarse fabric of their borrowed shirt cling. Before them lay a small, cleared patch of earth, a haphazard pile of mismatched twigs and branches Kael had grudgingly gathered, and a flint and steel that felt alien and brutish in their synth-skinned, delicate hands.

“A cooking fire,” the Rewilded Engineer had grunted earlier, her voice like rocks grinding together. She hadn’t offered her name, and Kael, intimidated by her sheer, uncompromising presence, hadn’t dared ask. Most here were just ‘Engineer,’ ‘Forager,’ ‘Healer’ – titles that defined their utility. Kael, it was becoming painfully clear, was, so far, ‘Useless.’ Or perhaps, ‘City-Dweller,’ usually uttered with a faintly pitying shake of the head.

The Engineer had gestured with her chin towards a crude spit already erected nearby, where a plucked, featherless bird – a creature Kael vaguely recognized from a zoological database as *Gallus gallus domesticus*, albeit a scrawnier version – awaited. “No fire, no food. And you don’t eat if you don’t work.”

Simple. Infuriatingly simple. And utterly beyond Kael’s current capabilities.

Kael fumbled with the flint and steel, the rough surfaces abrading their soft palms. The concept was archaic, something out of a badly rendered historical simulation. Sparks were meant to come from sonic igniters, or plasma starters, controlled by precise gestures or voice commands, not from striking two bits of rock and metal together with brute, uncalibrated force. Their first attempt, a hesitant tap, produced nothing. Their second, a more forceful scrape, sent a pathetic spark arcing sideways, landing harmlessly on the damp earth. A snicker, quickly suppressed but definitely heard, drifted from a group of younger Off-Gridders mending nets nearby with practiced, nimble fingers. Kael’s ears burned hotter than any spark they’d produced.

They tried again, gritting their teeth, remembering some physics principle about angles and friction. *This isn't quantum mechanics, Kael, it's just striking rocks.* This time, a spark – a decent one! – landed squarely on the tinder: a small bundle of dried grass and shaved bark the Engineer had provided without comment. It smoldered for a thrilling moment, a tiny orange eye, then, despite Kael’s hopeful stare, winked out.

“The wood is damp,” Kael muttered, prodding a branch with the toe of their equally useless, thin-soled boot. It felt heavy, saturated. Back in the arcology, moisture content was a precisely calibrated variable in any combustion process, managed by the environmentals. Here, it was just… wet. An obstacle.

“Then find dry wood,” the Engineer said, not looking up from the axe she was sharpening with a whetstone, each stroke rhythmic and purposeful. Her tone implied this was the most obvious thing in the world, a task any thinking entity should manage.

Kael ventured a short distance, scanning the undergrowth with an expression of distaste. Everything looked damp, or rotten, or covered in things that crawled. The air itself felt heavy with moisture from a recent rain shower they hadn’t even registered, cocooned as they’d been in their scratchy blanket inside the hut. They gathered a few more twigs, trying to select the least sodden ones by snapping them – most just bent limply – and returned to the fire pit, feeling the critical eyes of the net-menders on their back.

Another attempt. More feeble sparks. One caught, a tiny, courageous flame. Kael, in their eagerness, leaned in and blew on it, a desperate puff of air like one trying to accelerate a stalled processor fan. The flame promptly vanished. More laughter, less suppressed this time, accompanied by a comment:

“Trying to sweet-talk it, city-dweller? Fire don’t like whispers!” one of the youths called out, his face split by a grin.

Kael’s hands were trembling, not just from exertion, but from a rising tide of frustration and acute humiliation. They, Kael, who had interfaced with planetary network systems, who had debated multi-variant AI ethics, who had once re-calibrated the orbital trajectory of a communications satellite with a few elegant lines of code, couldn’t make fire. Couldn’t perform a task humans had mastered millennia ago. It was degrading.

They tried to arrange the wood in a cone, as they’d seen in some ancient vids. It collapsed. They tried a log-cabin structure. It also collapsed, scattering the precious, slightly-less-damp twigs. They scraped their knuckles with the flint. They got smoke in their eyes, which watered profusely, blurring their vision. They singed their fingertips, yelping and snatching their hand back, the smell of burnt synth-skin and their own flesh acrid in their nostrils. In a particularly clumsy moment, they knocked over the small waterskin they’d been given, the precious liquid soaking uselessly into the already damp earth, earning another round of chuckles.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of fumbling, smoke, spilled water, and quiet, persistent mockery, the Engineer rose. She moved with a fluid grace that belied her rugged appearance, her boots making little sound on the packed earth. Wordlessly, she crouched by the fire pit. Kael watched, shame coiling in their gut like a cold snake, stepping back to give her space, expecting a reprimand, or worse, pity.

The Engineer’s hands, calloused and sure, selected a few pieces of Kael’s discarded wood. With a knife Kael hadn’t seen her draw, its blade worn but keen, she shaved fine, feathery curls from the driest inner part of a branch, letting them fall into a small, airy pile on top of the tinder. She then took the flint and steel from Kael’s unresisting, dirt-stained fingers. Her grip was firm, practiced. She didn’t strike wildly. Instead, with a steady, patient rhythm, she drew the steel firmly down the flint, angling the sparks directly onto the feather sticks. Not once, not twice, but three times.

On the third strike, a shower of brilliant sparks caught on the feather sticks. She blew gently, not with Kael’s panicked, forceful puff, but with a long, controlled breath, like she was coaxing a living thing. The ember glowed, then blossomed into a tiny, confident flame. Slowly, deliberately, she added a few more small twigs, then slightly larger ones, building the fire with an instinct and knowledge Kael couldn’t fathom. It was like watching a master artisan at work, each movement precise, economical, and effective. Within minutes, a small, steady fire crackled merrily in the pit, radiating a welcome warmth that Kael, despite their humiliation, couldn’t help but lean towards.

The Engineer looked at Kael, her gaze direct, unwavering, holding no malice, only a stark assessment.

“No credits out here,” she said, her voice low but carrying clearly over the crackle of the new fire. “No simulations. No AI to hold your hand. No safety nets.” She gestured with her chin to Kael’s reddened, slightly blistered fingertips. “Just consequence. You learn, or you burn. You work, or you starve.”

She rose and walked back to her axe, leaving Kael staring at the flames, the simple, profound truth of her words settling into their bones like the chill of the coming night. This was the Off-Grid. And survival was a currency Kael had yet to earn, a language they had yet to speak. The small, dancing fire felt like a universe away from their previous life.
