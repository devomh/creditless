The transition from personal time to the evening cycle was usually as seamless as every other part of Kael’s day. A soft chime, a subtle shift in the pod’s lighting towards warmer, more relaxing hues. Kael was halfway through selecting a historical documentary – a curated choice offered by the AI concierge based on their previous viewing patterns – when the screen abruptly went black.

Not a gentle fade, but a sudden, stark void.

For a moment, Kael simply stared, a flicker of annoyance the only immediate emotion. Power fluctuations were unheard of, glitches like the one from earlier almost instantly self-corrected. This was different.

Then, red text, sharp and urgent, burned onto the darkened display:

**SYSTEM ALERT: COMPUTATIONAL CREDITS INSUFFICIENT.**
**ESSENTIAL SERVICES ONLY.**

Before Kael could fully process the words, a second message flashed beneath it:

**POD ACCESS DENIED: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**
**MOBILITY SYSTEMS OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**
**NUTRITION PRINTER OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**

A cold dread, wholly unfamiliar, began to creep up Kael’s spine. “Concierge?” Kael called out, voice sharper than intended.

Silence. The warm, ever-present voice of the AI was gone. The pod, usually humming with imperceptible activity, felt dead, inert.

“Concierge, report status!” Kael demanded, louder this time.

Only the oppressive silence answered. Panic, sharp and cold, began to set in. This wasn’t a minor hiccup. This was… an impossibility. Credits? Kael had never actively *thought* about credits. They were an invisible, omnipresent utility, like air, like power – managed by the system, for the system, never a concern for the individual. Until now.

Kael scrambled out of the chair, heart hammering against ribs suddenly too tight. They rushed to the pod door, the one that always hissed open with a polite greeting. Their hand slapped the activation panel. Nothing. No welcoming light, no subtle unlocking sound. They pushed, a useless, desperate shove against immovable plasteel.

“No,” Kael whispered, disbelief warring with the rising terror. They tried the manual override, a small, seldom-noticed latch near the doorframe. It wouldn’t budge, locked tight.

Think. There had to be a way. Administrative channels. Yes. Kael stumbled back to the main console. The red alert messages still dominated the screen. They tried to access the system diagnostics, the communication hub, anything. Each attempt was met with the same brutal efficiency as the system it governed:

**ACTION DENIED: REQUIRES COMPUTATIONAL CREDITS.**

“But I need to report this! This is an error!” Kael shouted at the blank screen, the words swallowed by the sudden, unnerving stillness of the pod. Every function, every pathway to seek help or understanding, was itself a task requiring the very resource they apparently lacked. The elevator to other levels would be offline. The comms to central administration… inaccessible.

The nutrient printer, usually ready to dispense the evening meal, was dark, its indicator light extinguished. A wave of dizziness washed over Kael. How could this happen? There was no warning, no indication. Efficiency Day had bled into… this. This silent, unresponsive prison.

The realization struck with the force of a physical blow: they were utterly, completely dependent on a system that had just declared them bankrupt. The pristine pod, once a symbol of effortless living, now felt like a tomb. The silence, once a mark of perfect order, now amplified the frantic thumping of their own heart. Trapped. And alone.
