# Insufficient Credits

The evening cycle usually began seamlessly. A soft chime, a subtle shift in the pod’s lighting to warmer hues – gentle amber, tonight. Kael, halfway through selecting a historical documentary about pre-Network societies, watched the main display—a vast expanse of shimmering light—not just go black, but *die*.

A sudden, stark void. A faint electronic sigh, as if the air itself had been sucked from the room. The ambient hum of the pod’s systems, a sound Kael had never consciously registered, vanished. Silence, heavy and absolute, pressed in.

Kael stared. A flicker of annoyance—their only immediate emotion. Power fluctuations were unheard of. Glitches, like the minor one earlier, were instantly self-corrected by the omnipresent System. This was different. This felt final.

Then, red text, stark and brutally sharp, burned onto the dead display, each letter clicking into place with an audible, dry finality:

**SYSTEM ALERT: COMPUTATIONAL CREDITS INSUFFICIENT.**
**ESSENTIAL SERVICES ONLY. ALL NON-CRITICAL FUNCTIONS TERMINATED.**

The words pulsed, a menacing crimson. Before Kael could fully process them, a cascade of secondary alerts erupted, and a cold, synthesized female voice – not their familiar concierge, but a default system announcer, devoid of warmth – began a chilling litany of failures:

“Warning: Pod access protocols require active credit balance. **POD ACCESS DENIED: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**” The door lock clanged shut, a definitive, metallic sound.
“Warning: Vertical mobility systems require active credit balance. **MOBILITY SYSTEMS OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**”
“Warning: Nutrient dispensation requires active credit balance. **NUTRITION PRINTER OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**”
“Warning: Environmental controls reverting to minimal life support. **CLIMATE CONTROL OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**”
“Warning: AI Concierge services require active credit balance. **CONCIERGE SERVICES OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**”

A cold dread, wholly unfamiliar, tightened Kael’s chest, stealing their breath. “Concierge?” Kael’s voice was sharp, higher than intended. They already knew the answer.

Silence. The warm, ever-present voice of their personal AI—anticipator of needs, manager of schedules, purveyor of gentle emotional support—gone. The pod, usually vibrant with imperceptible activity, felt like a vacuum: dead, inert, suddenly claustrophobic. The gentle amber lighting flickered, sputtered, and died, plunging Kael into the harsh, dim glare of a single emergency panel near the door.

“Concierge, report status! Override C-47!” Kael shouted, stumbling towards the main console, their voice echoing unnaturally in the sudden, tomb-like stillness.

Only oppressive silence answered, punctuated by the rhythmic, mocking pulse of the red warning text. Panic, sharp and cold, clawed at their throat. Not a hiccup. An impossibility. Credits? Kael had never *thought* about credits. An invisible, omnipresent utility, like air, like power—managed by the System, for the System. A birthright. How could they be *insufficient*? Like being told the air was unbreathable.

Kael scrambled from the chair, heart hammering, ribs too tight. They lunged for the pod door, the one that always hissed a polite greeting. Their palm slapped the activation panel. Nothing. No welcoming light. No subtle unlocking click. Just cold, unresponsive plasteel. They shoved—a useless, desperate heave against an immovable surface.

“No,” Kael whispered, disbelief warring with a terror that constricted their airway. “No, this is a mistake.” They fumbled for the manual override, a small, seldom-noticed latch near the doorframe, a relic from a safety briefing schematic. It wouldn’t budge. Sealed tight. Bankrupt.

*Think. Think!* Administrative channels. A system-wide error. Surely. Kael stumbled back to the main console, their reflection a pale, wide-eyed stranger in its dead screen. Red alerts pulsed. Frantically, they swiped, gestured—at nothing. Diagnostics, comms hub, anything. Each attempt met brutal, instantaneous denial, the cold voice intoning:

“**ACTION DENIED: REQUIRES COMPUTATIONAL CREDITS.**”

“But I need to report this! An error! A system fault!” Kael screamed at the impassive screen, voice cracking, the words swallowed by the unnerving stillness. Every function, every pathway to help, demanded the very resource they lacked. Elevator offline. Comms inaccessible. Their personal datapad, on a side table, mirrored the same crimson curse: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS. Trapped. Utterly.

The nutrient printer, usually aglow for the evening meal, was dark, lifeless. Dizziness washed over Kael; the memory of vanilla and almonds, a cruel joke. No warning. No indication. Efficiency Day had bled into this: a silent, unresponsive prison.

The realization struck—a physical blow. Utterly, completely dependent on a system that had just declared them non-existent. The pristine pod, symbol of effortless living, now a tomb. The silence, once perfect order, now amplified their frantic heartbeat, their ragged breathing. Trapped. Terrifyingly alone. The faint, metallic scent of dead electronics, unmasked by dormant air filtration, filled the space. The smell of a machine’s corpse.
