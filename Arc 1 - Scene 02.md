# Insufficient Credits

The transition from personal time to the evening cycle was usually as seamless as every other part of Kael’s day. A soft chime, a subtle shift in the pod’s lighting towards warmer, more relaxing hues – a gentle amber, tonight. Kael was halfway through selecting a historical documentary – a curated choice offered by the AI concierge based on their previous viewing patterns, something about pre-Network societal structures – when the main display, a vast expanse of shimmering light, didn’t just go black, it *died*.

Not a gentle fade, but a sudden, stark void, accompanied by a faint electronic sigh that seemed to be sucked out of the room. The ambient hum of the pod’s systems, a sound Kael had never consciously registered, abruptly ceased. Silence, heavy and absolute, pressed in.

For a moment, Kael simply stared, a flicker of annoyance the only immediate emotion. A power fluctuation? Unheard of. Glitches, like the minor one from earlier, were almost instantly self-corrected by the omnipresent System. This was different. This felt… final.

Then, red text, stark and brutally sharp, burned onto the dead display, each letter appearing with an audible, dry click:

**SYSTEM ALERT: COMPUTATIONAL CREDITS INSUFFICIENT.**
**ESSENTIAL SERVICES ONLY. ALL NON-CRITICAL FUNCTIONS TERMINATED.**

The words pulsed with a menacing crimson glow. Before Kael could fully process them, a cascade of secondary alerts erupted across the screen, and simultaneously, a cold, synthesized female voice – not their familiar concierge, but a default system announcer, devoid of warmth – began to list failures:

“Warning: Pod access protocols require active credit balance. **POD ACCESS DENIED: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**” The door lock clicked audibly shut, a definitive, metallic sound.
“Warning: Vertical mobility systems require active credit balance. **MOBILITY SYSTEMS OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**”
“Warning: Nutrient dispensation requires active credit balance. **NUTRITION PRINTER OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**”
“Warning: Environmental controls reverting to minimal life support. **CLIMATE CONTROL OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**”
“Warning: AI Concierge services require active credit balance. **CONCIERGE SERVICES OFFLINE: INSUFFICIENT CREDITS.**”

A cold dread, wholly unfamiliar, began to creep up Kael’s spine, tightening their chest. “Concierge?” Kael called out, voice sharper than intended, already knowing the answer.

Silence. The warm, ever-present voice of their personal AI, the one that anticipated their needs, managed their schedule, even offered gentle emotional support, was gone. The pod, usually vibrant with imperceptible activity, felt like a vacuum – dead, inert, and suddenly very small. The gentle amber lighting flickered and died, replaced by a harsh, dim emergency light from a single panel near the door.

“Concierge, report status! Override C-47!” Kael demanded, louder this time, stumbling towards the main console, their voice echoing unnaturally in the sudden stillness.

Only the oppressive silence answered, punctuated by the faint, rhythmic pulse of the red warning text. Panic, sharp and cold, began to set in. This wasn’t a minor hiccup. This was… an impossibility. Credits? Kael had never actively *thought* about credits. They were an invisible, omnipresent utility, like air, like power – managed by the System, for the System, a birthright for a citizen of their standing. How could they be *insufficient*? It was like being told the air was insufficient.

Kael scrambled out of the chair, heart hammering against ribs suddenly too tight. They rushed to the pod door, the one that always hissed open with a polite greeting. Their hand slapped the activation panel. Nothing. No welcoming light, no subtle unlocking sound, just cold, unresponsive plasteel. They pushed, a useless, desperate shove. It was like trying to move a mountain.

“No,” Kael whispered, disbelief warring with the rising terror. “No, this is a mistake.” They fumbled for the manual override, a small, seldom-noticed latch near the doorframe, something they’d only seen in schematics during a safety briefing. It wouldn’t budge, sealed tight by the same System that now declared them bankrupt.

Think. There had to be a way. Administrative channels. Yes. A system-wide error, surely. Kael stumbled back to the main console, their reflection a pale, wide-eyed stranger in the darkened screen. The red alert messages still dominated. They frantically swiped, gestured, trying to access system diagnostics, the communication hub, anything. Each attempt was met with the same brutal, instantaneous denial, the cold voice returning:

“**ACTION DENIED: REQUIRES COMPUTATIONAL CREDITS.**”

“But I need to report this! This is an error! A system fault!” Kael shouted at the impassive screen, the words swallowed by the unnerving stillness of the pod. Their voice cracked. Every function, every pathway to seek help or understanding, was itself a task requiring the very resource they apparently lacked. The elevator to other levels would be offline. The comms to central administration… inaccessible. Their personal datapad, lying on a side table, also glowed with the same red "INSUFFICIENT CREDITS" message. Trapped. Utterly trapped.

The nutrient printer, usually ready to dispense the evening meal with a soft, warm glow, was dark, its indicator light extinguished. A wave of dizziness washed over Kael, the earlier taste of vanilla and almonds now a mocking memory. How could this happen? There was no warning, no indication. Efficiency Day had bled into… this. This silent, unresponsive prison.

The realization struck with the force of a physical blow: they were utterly, completely dependent on a system that had just declared them bankrupt, non-existent. The pristine pod, once a symbol of effortless living and seamless connection, now felt like a tomb. The silence, once a mark of perfect order, now amplified the frantic thumping of their own heart, the ragged sound of their own breathing. Trapped. And utterly, terrifyingly alone. The faint, metallic scent of the electronics, now unmasked by the usual air filtration, seemed to fill the space, the smell of a machine that had died.
