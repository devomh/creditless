# Out in the Wild

The tunnel’s dark maw offered no comfort, only a desperate alternative to the silent, unresponsive pod-cage. How long Kael stared into that blackness, weighing known prison against terrifying unknown, they couldn’t say. The relentless red pulse of **INSUFFICIENT CREDITS** goaded them. Remain, and starve. Or descend into madness within pristine, indifferent walls. The tunnel was, at least, a choice. An act. A blind plunge.

Primal desperation overriding years of conditioned passivity, Kael dropped to hands and knees. Cool, stale air, thick with dust, rust, and a damp, fungal odor of forgotten things, washed over them. They crawled. The opening, surprisingly tight, scraped their shoulders. Rough, unpolished metal grated against their soft synth-fabric, its cold seeping through to uncalloused skin.

Darkness absolute. Not the pod’s controlled, graded dimness, but a pressing black velvet, smothering. It swallowed the pod’s faint red light instantly. Kael’s heart hammered, a frantic drum in the sudden tomb-like silence. Every rustle of clothing, every distant drip, every scrape of knee against metal, amplified, threatening. The tunnel twisted, turned, dipped sharply. Kael slid, scrambled, breath catching. The air grew thicker, damper, tasting of metal and mildew. A hand landed on something soft, yielding, disturbingly warm. A choked gasp—vermin? Decay?—and they scrambled blindly onward, fueled by the desperate need to escape this suffocating passage.

An eternity of scraped knees, aching muscles, near-hyperventilation. Then, a pinprick of faint, grey light. Agonizingly slow, it grew—a distant, mocking promise. A final, adrenaline-fueled push. Kael squeezed through a jagged, narrow opening, metal edges tearing clothes, and tumbled out—not onto polished arcology corridors, but onto soft, yielding, shockingly cold earth.

Gasping. Every muscle screamed. Rough stones and damp grit pressed against their cheek. The air… different. It *moved*. A gust, shockingly cold, carried a thousand alien scents: damp soil, decaying leaves, the sharp tang of crushed green things, a faint, unsettlingly sweet rot. It washed Kael’s face, raising goosebumps. Wind. Read about it, seen simulations rustle digital trees. To feel its raw, untamed caress, to have it invade nostrils and lungs—startling, almost violent. Alive. Utterly indifferent.

Kael pushed up. Their synth-suit, designed for pod-perfection, now torn at knee and elbow, smeared with thick, brown, clinging mud. Hands caked in it; grit under fingernails, deeply unpleasant. Vision swam. Around them, no arcology. Twisted, skeletal trees, branches black and bare, clawed a perpetually overcast sky that wept dim, grey light. Tenacious green weeds and vines, unnervingly vibrant, grew in chaotic profusion, reclaiming crumbling, angular plasteel and rusted metal jutting from the earth like forgotten bones. Profound neglect. A buffer zone between ordered city and… something else. Wild.

A sudden, high-pitched buzz. Kael flinched violently, cowering. An insect, iridescent green-black, larger than their thumb, delicate veined wings, landed boldly on their arm. Kael stared, frozen—horror and morbid fascination. Jointed, wiry legs tickled through thin fabric. Uncontrolled. Organic. Alien. It crawled, multifaceted eyes glinting, then flew off with an audible hum. Kael shuddered. Visceral revulsion. Dawning, terrifying unpreparedness for a world where things simply *lived*, unmanaged, untamed.

Shock yielded to pressing miseries. A gnawing hollowness in their stomach, insistent, sharp—not the polite, scheduled nutrient notification, but raw, aching hunger. The wind, once novel, now bit through thin pod-garments offering no real protection. Deep, penetrating chill settled into their bones. Each breath, heavy; unfiltered air, raw with particles, irritated their throat. Exhaustion, profound, bone-deep after tunnel and stress, a physical burden.

They stumbled forward, no destination, only a vague instinct to flee the tunnel’s oppressive dark. Uneven ground, littered with unseen debris. Slick patches of mud sucked at inadequate footwear. Tripped. Jarring impact on scraped hands. Tripped again. Their body screamed for rest, for the arcology’s familiar, effortless support.

Ahead, a solitary light pole, crooked, lamp housing shattered, exposing tangled dead wires. Yet, a faint, flickering, sickly yellow luminescence from a cracked solar collector panel at its base—a relic of past order, succumbing to pervasive decay. The only manufactured light in this desolate landscape. A dying ember in encroaching gloom.

Kael reached it, legs trembling, each step a monumental effort. Too much. Vision swam, grey landscape blurring. A low groan. They collapsed at its base, rough, rusted metal biting their back. Flickering light cast dancing, distorted shadows on their pale, dirt-streaked face. Wind whispered through skeletal trees, a mournful sigh. For the first time, Kael understood: truly alone, truly vulnerable, outside the machine’s cradle. The wilderness, this desolate place, had claimed them. The arcology’s sterile, predictable embrace, a universe away.
