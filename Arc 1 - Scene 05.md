A sensation of being dragged, a rough scraping against their back, was the first thing to penetrate Kael’s exhausted unconsciousness. Vague, disjointed images flickered behind their eyelids: the skeletal trees, the mocking, broken solar light, the crushing weight of a world they didn’t understand. Then, nothing but a deeper blackness, though less absolute than the service tunnel.

When awareness returned, it was to a dull ache throbbing through every limb and a profound stiffness in their neck. Kael lay on something coarse and unyielding – a mat of woven fibers, perhaps? The air tasted of woodsmoke, damp earth, and something else, faintly herbal. It was a far cry from the sterile, filtered air of the pod.

Kael’s eyes fluttered open. Above, rough-hewn wooden beams – actual tree trunks, bark partially intact – formed a low ceiling. The walls, too, were made of dark, unfinished logs, chinked imperfectly with what looked like dried mud or clay. Dust motes danced in the slivers of grey light filtering through a single, small window, which was covered with a stretched, translucent, yellowish material that was clearly not glass. The whole structure felt… assembled, not manufactured. This was no medical bay, no recovery suite. This was primitive. Hand-built. Raw.

A figure moved in the periphery. Kael tensed, a jolt of adrenaline trying to override the profound weakness. They tried to sit up, but a wave of dizziness and a chorus of protesting muscles forced them back down with a groan.

“Easy now,” a voice said. Blunt, female, with a rough edge that vibrated with a resonance Kael had never encountered in the smooth, synthesized tones of the arcology. “You were half-dead when I found you. Don’t finish the job.”

Kael focused on the speaker. A woman stood near a crude stone fireplace, her silhouette backlit by the dim glow of embers. As she stepped closer, details emerged. Her face was weathered, etched with lines that spoke of sun and wind, not age. Her hands, resting on her hips, were smudged with dirt, fingernails cracked and stained. She wore practical, patched clothing of a coarse, dark fabric. This was the Rewilded Engineer, though Kael wouldn’t know that name for some time.

Panic, cold and familiar, surged through Kael. “Where… where am I? You need to signal for a drone evacuation. My ID is 734-Alpha-Omega-9. I require immediate system reintegration.” The words tumbled out, a desperate plea for a reality that felt centuries away. “Or… or an emergency upload. There must be a local network node, even in a… a buffer zone like this.”

The woman looked down at Kael, a strange expression on her face – not unkind, but perhaps a flicker of weary amusement. Then, she laughed. It wasn’t a mocking sound, more a short, sharp bark of surprise, or perhaps resignation.

“Drone evac,” she repeated, as if tasting an exotic, unbelievable word. “Emergency upload.” She shook her head, the movement economical.

She turned, picked something up from a rough wooden table, and then crouched beside Kael. In her dirt-smudged hand, she held out a dented steel cup. Water sloshed gently within it.

“Here,” she said, her voice softer now, but still direct. “Drink. You’re dehydrated.”

Kael stared at the cup – dented, metallic, bearing the patina of long use – then at the woman’s face, searching for some flicker of the familiar, the logical, the systematic. There was none. The sheer, unadorned simplicity of the gesture was baffling, almost insulting in its directness. No analysis, no verification, no nutrient profile displayed on a nearby screen, no automated dispenser. Just a metal cup, held by a stranger with dirt under her fingernails, in a dirt-floored cabin. The water inside looked… real. Unfiltered. Troublingly so.

The request for a drone, for an upload, for any of the technological lifelines Kael had always taken for granted, now seemed not just out of place, but like words from a forgotten language, echoing foolishly in the quiet, smoky air of the cabin. The Engineer’s blunt dismissal, her almost pitying laughter, and the simple, undeniable offering of water, spoke more clearly than any diagnostic panel: the world Kael knew, the system that had defined their entire existence, was gone, or at least, irretrievably distant. This was what remained. This was Dirt. And this blunt, practical woman, with her calloused hands and knowing eyes, was its denizen. Fear, raw and disorienting, mingled with a dawning, terrifying, and utterly unwanted understanding.
