# Dragged to Dirt

Being dragged. Rough, scraping abrasion against back and legs: Kael’s first returning sensation. Jolting, uneven movement. Disjointed images flickered behind eyelids: skeletal trees clawing a weeping grey sky; the mocking, broken solar light; the crushing weight of an uncomprehended world. Then, deeper blackness, a suffocating void, less absolute than the tunnel but heavy with oblivion. Each jolt, a fresh stab of pain through their bruised body.

Awareness surfaced slowly, as if from deep, muddy water. A dull ache throbbed in every limb. Neck stiff, movement unthinkable. Kael lay on coarse, unyielding fibers—a mat, stiff and scratchy, smelling faintly of dry grass and dust. The air, thick, resisted entry into aching lungs. It *tasted* of woodsmoke, damp earth, something faintly herbal, alien—a world away from the pod’s sterile, filtered ozone. A persistent, dull throb pulsed behind their eyes.

Eyelids, heavy as lead, fluttered. Above, rough-hewn wooden beams—actual tree trunks, bark partially intact—formed a low, oppressive ceiling, casting strange shadows. Dark, unfinished log walls, chinked imperfectly with dried mud or clay, whistled softly with tiny drafts. Dust motes danced in slivers of grey light from a single, small, grime-streaked window, covered with stretched, translucent, yellowish animal hide—not glass. The structure felt… assembled. Primitive. Hand-built. Raw. No medical bay, no recovery suite. The very air felt ancient, heavy with the smells of lives lived close to earth.

A shadow detached itself from the deeper gloom near a crude stone fireplace where orange embers pulsed, a faint, living warmth. Kael tensed. Adrenaline attempted to override profound weakness. Tried to sit up, to scramble away—dizziness, protesting muscles. A barely audible groan escaped them. Limbs like lead.

“Easy now.” The voice, blunt, female, held a rough, gravelly edge, a resonance Kael had never encountered in the arcology’s smooth, synthesized tones. It had texture, like rough stone. “Half-dead when I found you, sprawled under that busted flicker-pole. Don’t finish the job thrashing.”

Kael blinked, focusing. A woman, backlit by embers. Stepping closer, details emerged from the gloom: a weathered face, sun-etched lines defying any familiar biometric of age. Slate-grey eyes, sharp, piercing even in dim light. Dirt-smudged, calloused hands on hips, fingernails cracked, earth-stained. Practical, patched clothing of coarse, dark fabric. Heavy, mud-caked boots. The Rewilded Engineer, though Kael wouldn’t know the name. Her presence, solid, unyielding as the log walls.

Panic, cold and familiar, surged—a desperate yearning for the known, the controlled. “Where… am I?” A dry, cracking whisper. “Signal drone evac. ID 734-Alpha-Omega-9. Central Registry. Require immediate system reintegration.” Words tumbled out, a desperate plea for a reality now centuries distant. “Or… emergency upload. Local network node… buffer zone… relay station…?” Kael’s mind clung to its familiar lexicon of solutions.

The woman’s slate-grey eyes remained unblinking. A strange expression—not unkind. Weary amusement? Profound incomprehension? Then, a laugh: short, sharp, dry like rustling leaves.

“Drone evac,” she repeated, the words alien in her mouth, like an exotic, unbelievable spice. “Emergency upload.” A slow, economical headshake, faint smile touching her lips. “Credits for that too, I suppose?”

She turned, retrieved something from a rough wooden table, then crouched with surprising agility. Her dirt-smudged, calloused hand held out a dented steel cup. Water, reflecting dim light, sloshed gently.

“Here.” Voice softer, still direct, uncompromising. “Drink. You’re dehydrated. Real water. From sky, then earth. No charge.”

Kael stared. The cup: dented, metallic, patina of long use, clearly not self-cleaning or nutrient-enriched. The woman’s face: no flicker of the familiar, the logical, the systematic. The gesture’s sheer, unadorned simplicity was baffling, almost insulting. No analysis, no verification, no nutrient profile on a nearby screen, no automated dispenser confirming purity. Just a metal cup. Held by a stranger with dirt under her fingernails. In a dirt-floored cabin. The water looked… real. Unfiltered. Troublingly so. Teeming, likely, with microbes Kael’s regulated system had never met.

Drone requests, uploads, technological lifelines—words from a forgotten, foolish language, echoing absurdly in the quiet, smoky air. The Engineer’s blunt dismissal, her almost pitying laugh, the simple, undeniable water: these spoke more clearly than any diagnostic panel. Kael’s world, their defining System, was gone. Irretrievably distant. This remained. Dirt. And this blunt, practical woman, its denizen. Fear, raw, disorienting, mingled with a dawning, terrifying, utterly unwanted understanding. The steel cup felt heavier than any data-slate.
