# Dragged to Dirt

A sensation of being dragged, a rough, scraping abrasion against their back and legs, was the first thing to penetrate Kael’s exhausted unconsciousness. The movement was jolting, uneven. Vague, disjointed images flickered behind their eyelids: the skeletal trees clawing at a weeping grey sky, the mocking, broken solar light, the crushing weight of a world they didn’t understand. Then, nothing but a deeper blackness, a suffocating void, though less absolute than the service tunnel. Each jolt sent shivers of pain through their bruised body.

When awareness returned, it was slow, like surfacing from deep, muddy water. A dull ache throbbed through every limb, and a profound stiffness in their neck made even the thought of movement painful. Kael lay on something coarse and unyielding – a mat of woven fibers, stiff and scratchy against their skin, smelling faintly of dry grass and dust. The air was thick, difficult to draw into aching lungs. It *tasted* of woodsmoke, damp earth, and something else, faintly herbal and unfamiliar, a far cry from the sterile, filtered, perfectly ozoned air of the pod. A persistent, dull throbbing pulsed behind their eyes.

Kael’s eyelids, heavy as lead, fluttered open. Above, rough-hewn wooden beams – actual tree trunks, bark partially intact and casting strange shadows – formed a low, oppressive ceiling. The walls, too, were made of dark, unfinished logs, chinked imperfectly with what looked like dried mud or clay, through which tiny drafts of cold air whistled softly. Dust motes danced in the slivers of grey light filtering through a single, small, grime-streaked window, which was covered with a stretched, translucent, yellowish material – animal hide, perhaps? – that was clearly not glass. The whole structure felt… assembled, not manufactured. Primitive. Hand-built. Raw. This was no medical bay, no recovery suite. The very air felt ancient, heavy with the smells of lives lived close to the earth.

A figure moved in the periphery, a shadow detaching itself from the deeper gloom near a crude stone fireplace where orange embers pulsed with a faint, living warmth. Kael tensed, a jolt of adrenaline trying to override profound weakness. They tried to sit up, to scramble away, but a wave of dizziness and a chorus of protesting muscles forced them back down with a groan that was barely audible even to their own ears. Their limbs felt like lead weights.

“Easy now,” a voice said. Blunt, female, with a rough, gravelly edge that vibrated with a resonance Kael had never encountered in the smooth, synthesized, perfectly modulated tones of the arcology. The sound itself seemed to have texture, like running a hand over rough stone. “You were half-dead when I found you, sprawled under that busted flicker-pole. Don’t finish the job by thrashing about.”

Kael blinked, trying to focus on the speaker. A woman stood near the crude stone fireplace, her silhouette backlit by the dim glow of the embers. As she stepped closer, details emerged from the gloom. Her face was weathered, etched with lines that spoke of sun and wind, not of chronological age according to any bio-metric Kael understood. Her eyes, sharp and piercing even in the dim light, were the color of slate. Her hands, resting on her hips, were smudged with dirt, calloused, fingernails cracked and stained with earth. She wore practical, patched clothing of a coarse, dark fabric, and heavy, mud-caked boots. This was the Rewilded Engineer, though Kael wouldn’t know that name for some time. Her presence was as solid and unyielding as the log walls.

Panic, cold and familiar, surged through Kael, a desperate yearning for the known, the controlled. “Where… where am I?” Their voice was a dry whisper, cracking. “You need to signal for a drone evacuation. My ID is 734-Alpha-Omega-9. Central Registry. I require immediate system reintegration.” The words tumbled out, a desperate plea for a reality that felt centuries, not mere hours, away. “Or… or an emergency upload. There must be a local network node, even in a… a buffer zone like this. A relay station… anything.” Kael’s mind clung to the familiar lexicon of solutions, the only ones it knew.

The woman looked down at Kael, her slate-grey eyes unblinking. A strange expression flickered across her face – not unkind, but perhaps a flicker of weary amusement, or maybe just profound incomprehension. Then, she laughed. It wasn’t a mocking sound, more a short, sharp bark of surprise, or perhaps resignation, dry like rustling leaves.

“Drone evac,” she repeated, the words alien in her mouth, as if tasting an exotic, unbelievable spice. “Emergency upload.” She shook her head slowly, the movement economical, a faint smile playing on her lips. “Credits for that, too, I suppose?”

She turned, picked something up from a rough wooden table Kael hadn’t noticed, and then crouched beside them with surprising agility. In her dirt-smudged, calloused hand, she held out a dented steel cup. Water, reflecting the dim light, sloshed gently within it.

“Here,” she said, her voice softer now, but still direct, uncompromising. “Drink. You’re dehydrated. Real water. From the sky, then the earth. No charge.”

Kael stared at the cup – dented, metallic, bearing the patina of long use, clearly not self-cleaning or nutrient-enriched – then at the woman’s face, searching for some flicker of the familiar, the logical, the systematic. There was none. The sheer, unadorned simplicity of the gesture was baffling, almost insulting in its directness. No analysis, no verification, no nutrient profile displayed on a nearby screen, no automated dispenser confirming purity levels. Just a metal cup, held by a stranger with dirt under her fingernails, in a dirt-floored cabin. The water inside looked… real. Unfiltered. Troublingly so. It probably teemed with microbes Kael’s perfectly regulated system had never encountered.

The request for a drone, for an upload, for any of the technological lifelines Kael had always taken for granted, now seemed not just out of place, but like words from a forgotten, foolish language, echoing absurdly in the quiet, smoky air of the cabin. The Engineer’s blunt dismissal, her almost pitying laughter, and the simple, undeniable offering of water, spoke more clearly than any diagnostic panel: the world Kael knew, the system that had defined their entire existence, was gone, or at least, irretrievably distant. This was what remained. This was Dirt. And this blunt, practical woman, with her calloused hands and knowing eyes, was its denizen. Fear, raw and disorienting, mingled with a dawning, terrifying, and utterly unwanted understanding. The steel cup felt heavier than any data-slate.
