You've crafted a remarkably detailed and structured blueprint for a novella, one that skillfully combines character arc, thematic richness, and speculative depth. Your question focuses on whether there is a specific **name** for a section that includes *special rules, constraints, or considerations that don't fit into other categories* ‚Äî and whether any **sections are missing** in your outline. Let's tackle each in turn.

---

## üß© 1. **Is There a Section Name for "Special Rules, Constraints, or Considerations"?**

Yes ‚Äî in narrative design, game writing, and occasionally in screenwriting, a section like that is often referred to as:

### üîπ **"Narrative Design Notes"**, **"Author's Notes"**, or **"Design Constraints"**

These terms can encompass:

* **Rules of the World** not captured in direct exposition (e.g., no internal monologues from AIs).
* **Stylistic boundaries** (e.g., no flashbacks, or only one metaphor per log).
* **Thematic do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts** (e.g., no techno-utopian resolution).
* **Mechanics of storytelling** (e.g., character logs never directly contradict narrated scenes).

You might include a new section like this:

---

### **13. Narrative Constraints & Design Notes** *(Suggested Addition)*

| Constraint Type          | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Narrative Limitation** | Logs must evolve in language complexity but never contain exposition dumps. |
| **World Rule**           | Compute-credits cannot be stored offline; disconnection is absolute.        |
| **Stylistic Rule**       | Metaphors must be rooted in the physical, not digital, world.               |
| **Symbol Usage**         | Solar symbols must only appear after moments of growth.                     |

---

Alternatively, if you'd like to keep a more literary tone, you could title it something like:

* **‚ÄúGuiding Principles‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúStructural Parameters‚Äù**
* **‚ÄúDesign Ethos‚Äù**

These labels suggest intentional creative boundaries without sounding overly technical.

## üß≠ 2. **Are Any Sections Missing?**

Your outline is impressively comprehensive, but a few potential additions might serve to enhance coherence and guide actual drafting or revision. Here are **optional but useful** additions:

---

### üî∏ **Character Arcs Chart** *(Optional Section)*

A simple table tracking each main character's development beats or key moments per act. This is especially useful for ensuring transformation is paced and thematic.

| Character         | Act I           | Act II             | Act III               |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Techno-Heir       | Arrogant, lost  | Learner, open      | Reflective, prophetic |
| Rewilded Engineer | Grudging, blunt | Stern mentor       | Quietly proud         |
| Solar Matriarch   | Distant, wise   | Guiding, revealing | Silent but hopeful    |

---

### üî∏ **Visual / Aesthetic Design Palette** *(If visually oriented or for adaptation)*

If you're considering adaptation into a visual medium or designing for mood, this section helps guide atmosphere.

* **Color Palette**: Sterile neons (Wired), sun-dappled earth tones (Off-Grid)
* **Textures**: Polished composites vs. cracked ceramics, worn leather
* **Lighting**: Ambient AI hues vs. flame and sunlight
* **Sound Motifs**: AI voice chimes vs. birdsong, crackling fires

---

### üî∏ **Philosophical Questions in Each Act** *(For thematic scaffolding)*

A subtle guide to thematic evolution ‚Äî especially useful in stories with philosophical undercurrents.

| Act        | Central Question                                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Collapse   | *What remains of us when the systems fail?*        |
| Adaptation | *What does it mean to be capable, or valuable?*    |
| Return     | *Can we change a world by telling a better story?* |

## ‚úÖ Final Suggestions

To summarize:

* You can add a section titled **"Narrative Design Notes"** or **"Guiding Constraints"** to house meta-level rules.
* While nothing is ‚Äúmissing‚Äù per se, additional optional sections like **Character Arc Charts**, **Philosophical Act Questions**, or **Aesthetic Palettes** may assist future versions, drafts, or collaborators (editors, artists, developers).

This structure is already extremely strong and usable, whether for writing, adaptation, or collaborative development. If you plan to **teach from this** or share it as a template for students or mentees, the clarity and modularity are excellent.

# **TODO**:

1. Read again the novella and make additional annotations, comments, or clarifications to improve, explain, or introduce more details to the story.
2. The details can be about:
  - Why humans have to confirms AI work. Only intelligence was achieved, alignment was never completely successful, to avoid deception humans should read the work.
  - Emotional contact in the Wired arcology was very scarce. People were mostly absorved by online interaction and hedonism. Direct physical interaction is uncomfortable. 
  - More details of the arcology (possible future image generation)
  - Introduce some humor in act 2 due to the naivity of the MC.
  - In the end try to suggest a reason for the system disconnection. Maybe some annotation in a report.
  - In the end indicate (subtle detail) with a brief comment that the MC publication attracted the interest of more people
